# 📂 Data Folder

This folder contains the dataset used in the project.

* `data/` → Stores the main dataset file used for the analysis.

  * `logs_exp_us.xlsx` → User event log from the food app A/A/B experiment.
* `samples/` → (optional) May include small public samples for demonstration purposes.
* `raw/` → (not tracked) Should contain the original unprocessed dataset. **Do not commit large or sensitive files**.

## Notes

The full dataset is stored locally and is not included in the GitHub repository due to size and privacy restrictions.
To reproduce the analysis, place the file **`logs_exp_us.xlsx`** inside the `data/` folder before running the notebook.
